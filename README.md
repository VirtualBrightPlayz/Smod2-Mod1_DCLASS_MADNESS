# DClass Madness
DClass Madness is a gamemode made for SMod2 (https://github.com/Grover-c13/Smod2/) for SCP:SL (https://store.steampowered.com/app/700330/) where Everyone is spawned as a Class-D except one person is spawned as SCP-173.
Upon Chaos spawning, they will spawn as MTF Commanders.
## Notes
This is still a work in progress.
